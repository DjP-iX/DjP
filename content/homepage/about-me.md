![Dan Pizappi](/images/headshot-bw.jpg)

I’m Dan Pizappi, a Technical Documentation Engineer at iXsystems, the open storage company behind TrueNAS.
My responsibilities include both hardware and software documentation, front-end web development, and managing a docs-as-code toolchain using Git, static site generation, and languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and YAML.

I hold a PhD in English from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and have extensive experience in research, analysis, writing, and instructional design.
Over the years, I’ve contributed to various academic and literary projects, including planning more than a dozen conferences, serving as Managing Editor for *Grist: A Journal of the Literary Arts*, and teaching as a Lecturer in the University of Tennessee English Department.
I’m also a past president of the Elizabeth Madox Roberts Society, a small literary-studies NPO, where I continue to serve on the board.

In addition to my technical and academic work, I practice creative writing, working in both poetry and fiction.
My work has appeared in publications including *Still: the Journal*, *Anti-Heroin Chic*, *The Mantle*, *Nixes Mate Review*, and *Dark Marrow*.
In my free time, I enjoy reading, making music, cooking, and trying my hand at gardening.
